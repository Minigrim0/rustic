# Input module
This module aims at converting "any" input into a standardised format, used by the rest of the application.
This is done through mapping some input signals into functions that can perform the desired actions.

# Keyboard example
The keyboard example is a simple example of how the input module can be used. This maps a physical computer keyboard to the input module.

| Key | Action | Comment |
| --- | ------ | ------- |
| `1`-`=` | chromatic scale notes | The actual mapping to notes is determined by the currently selected octave |
| `q`-`]` | chromatic scale notes | The actual mapping to notes is determined by the currently selected octave |
